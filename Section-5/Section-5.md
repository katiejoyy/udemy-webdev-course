# HTML Tables
### What are tables?
- Tables are structured sets of data made up of rows and columns. They can be a great way of displaying data clearly.

### Early usage
- In the early days of the web, tables were commonly used to create page layouts. Today you should only use the table element when you are creating an actual data table.

### Lots of elements!
- To create a table, you'll use 5 -10 different elements! It can be tricky to remember them all but dont panic!

## Table elements
- <td> element defines a cell of a table that contains data. It participates in the table model.

- <tr> element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established using a mix of <td> and <th> elements.

- <th> element defines a cell as header of a group of table cells. The exact nature of this group is defined by the scope and headers attributes.

- <tbody> encapsulates a set of table rows, indicating that they comprise the body of the table

- <colspan> attribute defines the number of columns a cell should span

- <rowspan> attribute defines the number of rows a cell should span
