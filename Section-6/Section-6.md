# CSS
### What is it?
- CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually- how they are arranged and styled.

### What does it stand for?
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We'll cover the "cascading " part in a bit: don't worry about it for now!

### There's a lot!
- CSS is very easy to get the hang of, but it can be intimidating becuase of how many properties we can manipulate.

## Including styles
### Inline styles
- You can write your styles directly inline on each eleemnts, but this is NOT A GOOD IDEA most of the time

### The <style> element
- You can wrtie your styles inside of a <style> element.This is easy, but it makes it impossible to share styles between documents. NOT RECOMMENDED EITHER!

### External stylesheet
- Write your styles in a .css file and then include the using a <link> in the head of your html document. RECOMMENDED!

### HEX
- Still red, green, and blue channels
- Each ranges from 0-255 represented with hexadecimal
- is base 16

### Font-size
- Relative and Absolute font size values
- Absolute untis are not recommeneded for responsive webistes
