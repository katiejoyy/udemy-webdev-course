# Section 4
Html 5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the lanugage HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviours, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful web sites and applications.

## Inline & block elements
### Inline elements
Inline elements fit in the alongside other elemts
Block level elements talk up a whole "block" of space

### Div
The HTML content division element is the generic container for flow content. Is a block level element. Can group content together.

### Span
The HTML span element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes. Span is very much like a div elements but div is a block-level element whereas a span is an inline element.

### hr
The HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

### br
The HTML element produces a line break in text. It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the divsion of lines is significant.

## #sup
The HTML superscript element scecifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.

### sub
The HTML subscript element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baselines using smaller text.

## HTML entities
 - Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon
 - Used to display reserved characters, that normally would be invalid
 - Also used in place of difficult to type characters
 - The brower interprets them and renders the correct character instead.
